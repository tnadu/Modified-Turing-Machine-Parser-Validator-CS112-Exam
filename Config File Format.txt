# - commented line is marked with the '#' symbol
# - the order of the sections (sigma, gamma, states, transitions) 
# must be matched
# - empty lines are not allowed
# - any config file which contains non-commented lines after the
# 'End' keyword of the 'transitions' section will be rejected
Sigma:
    # - a single line consisting of the alphabet letters concatenated
    # - the string can have as many whitespace characters as desired 
    # on either side
    # - only alphanumerical characters and the '#' symbol are allowed 
    # in the string (standard ASCII)
    # - example of Σ = {a, b, c, d}:
    abcd
End
#
#
#
Gamma:
    # - multiple lines consisting of a single character with as many
    # whitespaces as desired on either side or of three characters:
    # the letter of gamma itself, a space character and the letter 
    # B/b (which marks it as the blank symbol)
    # - there must be one and only one blank symbol, 
    # which can be marked on any line
    # - all UTF-8 characters are allowed
    # - example of Γ = {x, _}:
    x
    _ B
End
#
#
#
States:
    # - multiple lines consisting of a single string with as many
    # whitespaces as desired on either side, but none in the string
    # itself or of three strings: the state of Q itself, a space 
    # character and one of the characters S/s (which marks it as the
    # start state), A/a (which marks it as the accept state), R/r
    # (which marks it as the reject state)
    # - there must be one and only one of each type of state 
    # (start, accept, reject), which can be marked on any line
    # - only alphanumerical characters are allowed in the string 
    # describing the state (standard ASCII)
    # - example of Q = {q0, q1, q2, q3}:
    q0 S
    q1
    q2 A
    q3 R
End
#
#
#
Transitions:
    # - multiple lines consisting of the 7-tuple corresponding to
    # the elements of all the sets which make up both the domain
    # and the codomain
    # - all 7 strings are delimited by the space character with 
    # as many whitespaces as desired on either side
    # - example of δ: Q x Γ x Γ -> Q x Γ x Γ x {R/L}:
    q0 a b q2 c d R
End
