# CS112 Exam
__Exercise 1.__ Imagine a Turing Machine (TM) that has one head and two
tapes. The second tape must be a copy of the first one. Imagine the second tape
as a backup copy of the first one, so it can be used to detect possible storage
errors. You need to:
1. Give formal definition of this type of TM.
2. Give a clear explanation of computation for this type of TM. Include a
formal description of computation.

You can approach the construction of this TM as a multiple-head TM or a single
head TM with an interlaced tape or a single head TM with two inputs/outputs.
Be creative but rigorous.


__Exercise 2.__ Implement a library/program (in a programming language
of your choice) to load and validate a configuration file of a TM with one head
and two tapes. Also implement a simulator for this type of TM.


__Exercise 3.__ Extend the TM simulator to validate if the two tapes are
identical using as input the configuration file from previous exercise. An imme-
diate approach is to compare the two tapes (arrays) which is fine, but we want
an extended Î´ function in such a way that when then TM will reach a previous
final state (as a normal TM) will proceed to check of the two tapes are identical
and if so then enter to a new final state.


__Exercise 4.__ Create a configuration file for a one head, two tapes TM
that recognize the language L = {w#w|where w is a string} and also check for
the integrity of the tapes (if they are identical).
